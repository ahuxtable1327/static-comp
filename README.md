# Static Comp

## Introduction

The Static Comp project was set in order to hone in on our creativity and html abilities. The [spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/m1-static-comp) is one that lays out a general comp for us to recreate the layout, but with full creative license on the content and styling. The objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. The spec displays a business conference, however I decided to create something a little more low key and have offered viewers a cocktail to make and a song to listen to while you enjoy the beverage!
